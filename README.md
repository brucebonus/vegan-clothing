## 1.1.1 Background
I have been tasked to create a responsive website or web application that attempts to elevate, and, in part, solve a world problem.
The idea I have come up with is creating a vegan clothing website which promotes different vegan clothing brands. I have chose this problem because I feel like people forget
what materials are used in their clothes. I want to promote that we can wear the same look without the use of animals.
